<h2><a id="Methodology_0"></a>Methodology</h2>
<p>Our browser compatibility policy is based on looking at the analytics for our websites. The general rule of thumb is any browser with less than 0.1% of all sessions probably doesn’t need to be supported. Exceptions to this rule may come up if a browser has relatively low usage, is no longer supported, and is very hard for us to support.</p>
<h2><a id="Supported_Browsers_last_updated_April_7th_2016_4"></a>Supported Browsers (last updated April 7th, 2016)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chrome</strong>: 40</li>
<li><strong>Safari (desktop)</strong>: 5 (partial)
<ul>
<li>It should look reasonable and function in Safari 5, but doesn’t have to be perfect</li>
<li>Safari 6 should be fully functioning and look completely correct</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Firefox</strong>: 38</li>
<li><strong>IE</strong>: 11 and Edge
<ul>
<li>Support was dropped for IE 8/9/10 when they were no longer supported by Microsoft AND usage dropped bellow 1%</li>
<li>Up until relatively recently IE 8 was the most used version of IE by a large margin, thus why it took so long for us to change our policy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Opera</strong> and <strong>Opera Mini</strong>
<ul>
<li>Usage of these browsers is low enough that we only support the most modern version</li>
<li>Luckily if it works in Chrome, it should work in all the most recent versions of Opera</li>
<li>When this was written we had more sessions coming from Opera Mini than Opera</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Safari for iOS</strong>: whatever shipped with iOS 9 and above
<ul>
<li>Most users seem to be keeping up with the latest version of iOS</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
